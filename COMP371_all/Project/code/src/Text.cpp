            "planets. It is a massive ball of hot, glowing gases primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. The"
            "Sun's energy is generated through nuclear fusion in its core, where temperatures reach millions of"
            "degrees Celsius. Solar flares and sunspots are phenomena that occur on its surface, affecting "
            "space weather and communications on Earth. Despite being 93 million miles away, the Sun's "
            "immense gravitational pull keeps all the planets in orbit around it. It's estimated that the Sun is "
            "about 4.6 billion years old and will continue to shine for billions of years to come.\n";

            "Its atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid. Interestingly, Venus "

std::string uranus_description() {
    return "Uranus is an ice giant, composed mainly of water, ammonia, and methane. It's unique among "
            "the planets because it rotates on its side, likely due to a collision in its distant past. This tilt "
            "gives it extreme seasons, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight followed "

            "is the Great Dark Spot, a massive storm system similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Despite its "
            "distance, it completes an orbit around the Sun roughly every 165 Earth years. Neptune has 14 "
            "known moons, with Triton being the largest and most intriguing, as it orbits the planet in a "
            "direction opposite to Neptune's rotation.\n";
